# ADMM_CT
The code in this repository accompanies the paper:

Convergence for nonconvex ADMM, with applications to CT imaging.
Rina Foygel Barber and Emil Y. Sidky. http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07278

Code to reproduce the quantile regression example:
* nonconvex_admm_sparseQR.ipynb

Code to reproduce the CT image reconstruction simulation: 
* nonconvex_admm_CTsimulation.ipynb
* scanner_layout.png - provides a figure needed to compile the notebook.

Code for a version of the CT simulation with lower signal-to-noise ratio:
* nonconvex_admm_CTsimulation_lowSNR.ipynb

Code for a version of the CT simulation with an added total variation penalty:
* nonconvex_admm_CTsimulation_TVregularization.ipynb
